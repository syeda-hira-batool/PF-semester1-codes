    <section id="MyIntro">
         <br>
        <br>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;My Name is Syeda Hira Batool. I am currently studying CS in FAST NUCES and this is my first semester. At university, I’m passionate about learning &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;programming languages like C and exploring fields related to technology and problem-solving. I always try to ensure that my work is well-organized and &nbsp; &nbsp; complete — whether it’s writing essays, preparing assignments, or coding projects. I’m the kind of student who likes to double-check details, ask for feedback, &nbsp; &nbsp;and continuously improve. My goal is to grow not only as a computer scientist but also as a confident, well-rounded individual who contributes positively to my &nbsp;field and community. My passion for technology comes from a deep curiosity about how things work and how they can be improved through innovation. I’ve always been fascinated by the logic behind computers, the creativity in coding, and the endless possibilities technology offers to solve real-world problems. Studying Computer Science at FAST–NUCES has strengthened this passion, as it allows me to explore programming, algorithms, and system design — all of which challenge me to think critically and creatively.

What excites me most about tech is its power to build, automate, and connect. Whether it’s writing efficient code, understanding how data moves, or designing user-friendly solutions, I enjoy every part of the process. I see technology as more than just a career — it’s a space where I can express ideas, innovate, and make an impact. My goal is to continue learning, experimenting, and one day contribute to meaningful projects that use technology to make people’s lives better.</p>

            <summary>The projects I have been working on: </summary>
            Throughout my studies in Computer Science at FAST–NUCES, I’ve worked on several projects that have helped me strengthen my programming and problem-solving skills. In C programming, I’ve developed programs such as a password validation system that uses a negated scanset to ensure the input contains only numbers and symbols, a program to find the most common number in an array, and a password length checker that counts characters entered by the user. I also practiced algorithmic thinking by performing dry runs of bubble sort and binary search, which helped me understand how data is sorted and searched efficiently. Additionally, I created a spring force calculation program that applied physics concepts like force constants and trigonometric functions in code, allowing me to connect scientific principles with programming logic.

            Beyond coding, I’ve also worked on SQL projects, where I wrote queries to list employees and their departments, count employees in each department, and filter records based on job titles and hire dates. These tasks helped me understand how data is structured, stored, and retrieved in real-world systems. Alongside my technical projects, I’ve also written academic essays, such as one on Sir Syed Ahmad Khan’s contributions to the Ideology of Pakistan, which improved my research and writing skills. Together, these projects have strengthened both my analytical and creative abilities, deepening my passion for technology and learning.
